# what-to-eat
What To Eat is an application that helps users who can't decide what they want to cook or eat choose with the simple push of a button.

# Motivation
This app was built for those moments when no one can decide what to eat. This app allows users to click a button and have a random meal choice presented to them. If the user likes the chosen meal, they can click on the image and the recipe will be presented to them. If they don't want the meal, they can simply re-click the button for another random meal option.
